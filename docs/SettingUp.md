## Setting up the project on your computer

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:** Follow the steps below precisely. The setup may fail if you skip or change a step.
</box>

First, **fork** this repo, and **clone** the fork into your computer.

If you plan to use IntelliJ IDEA (highly recommended):

1. **Configure the JDK**: Follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html) to ensure Intellij is configured to use **JDK 17**.
1. **Import the project as a Gradle project**: Follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html) to import the project into IDEA.
   <box type="warning" seamless>
   Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
   </box>
1. **Verify the setup**:
   1. Run `seedu.address.Main` and try a few commands.
   1. [Run the tests](Testing.md) to ensure they all pass.

## Before writing code

1. **Configure the coding style**

   If using IDEA, follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the code style_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html) to set up IDEA's coding style to match ours.

   **Tip:**
    Optionally, follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] Using Checkstyle_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html) to learn how to use Checkstyle in IDEA, for example to report problems _as_ you write code.
   </box>

1. **Set up CI**

   This project includes GitHub Actions configuration files in `.github/workflows`. GitHub runs CI automatically for every push and pull request. No setup is required.

1. **Learn the design**

   When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about [AddressBook’s architecture](DeveloperGuide.md#architecture).

1. **Do the tutorials**
   These tutorials will help you get acquainted with the codebase.
